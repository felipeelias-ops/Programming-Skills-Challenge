* question3.cpp contains the solution for the Challenge number 3. 
This simple code just runs a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 100, multiples of 3 will show "Foo".
Multiples of 5 will print "Baa" and multiples of 3 and 5 will print the string "FooBaa".
The user can just compile and run, no input is required.

* question4.cpp contains the solution for the Challenge number 4. 
This code compares two user supplied strings, the user also provides an integer. The code checks if it can transform the first string into the second string using the user supplied integer. First the code compares two strings and counts the number of the first characters that match. The total number of non-equal characters is used to check whether the conversion is possible. The user is prompted for two strings and a number. The code only gives two answers: "yes" if the conversion is possible or "no" if it is not possible.

* question5.cpp contains the solution for the Challenge number 5. 

The user can just compile and run, no input is required.

* question6.sql contains the solution for the Challenge number 6. 

* question8.sql contains the solution for the Challenge number 8. 

* question10.cpp contains the solution for the Challenge number 10. 



* question11.cpp contains the solution for the Challenge number 11.
